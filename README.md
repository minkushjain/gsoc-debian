# Subscribing to Mailing List

## Description

This script automates the process of subscribing to Debian mailing list by sending your email and then confirming it through a customised reply by mail. 

The input would be entered by the user in a PyQt Based GUI application.

## Getting Started
Pyqt 5 library should be installed in the Python environment.

Excecute the file "Subscribing_mailing_list.py" in Python IDLE to start the program.

The user would be prompted to enter the email that he/she wants to get subscribed in the mailing list.

After entering the mail, the program would then ask for the confirmation string recieved by the user on the mail.

The user would hence get succesfully subscribed to the mailing list :smiley:
